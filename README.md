# discord-key-bot
A bot for discord that accepts, announces, and gives out keys

This requires a conf.json file (or whatever you choose to name the config file). An editable example is provided. It will need your bot token, a channel (using the channel ID number) to use for broadcast messages, and the name of the json/db file for key storage

In the channel itself the bot will need 'Manage Messages' permission, as the bot will erase any '!add' commands sent in in the channel so that keys do not appear publicly
